# Webpage-Color-Switcher
This is a web development project where the background color of the web page switches as soon as the user clicks on the "Switch Color" button.

The background color is the RGB value of it, and it switches the color into a random color as soon as the user clicks on it.

Note: The RGB value of color defines the intensity of the color and each value (red, blue, and green) is between 0 and 255.

The button to switch the color is in the center of the web page.

This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JS.
